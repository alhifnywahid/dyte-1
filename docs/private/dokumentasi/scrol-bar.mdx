        What is the difference between <code>DytePlugin.init()</code> and <code>DytePlugin.ready()</code>?
    </summary>
    <p>
        <code>plugin.init()</code> is called to initialise the plugin and <code>plugin.ready()</code> is called when the plugin is ready to emit and receive events from the client app. <b>Usually these events occur one after the other and the user need not manually call <code>plugin.ready()</code></b>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>plugin.ready()</code> can be manually used to control when this communication starts.
    </p>

    import DytePlugin from "@dytesdk/plugin-sdk";
    ...
    const plugin = await DytePlugin.init({ready: false});

    // .. do something

    plugin.ready();
