# Use React Native Core Hooks

Dyte's React Native UI Kit provides multiple
[Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react). Hooks let you use different
React features from your components.

This provides seamless developer experience when integrating Dyteâ€™s

This page lists all the built-in Hooks in Dyte.

- `<DyteProvider />`
- `<DyteUIProvider />`
- `useDyteMeeting()`
- `useDyteSelector()`

## `<DyteProvider />`

It is a simple context provider providing the meeting object to child
components.
## `<DyteUIProvider />`

It is a simple context provider providing the dyte design system to child
components. 

And to consume the context value, we provide two more hooks, each serving a
specific purpose.

These are:

- `useDyteMeeting()`
- `useDyteSelector()`

## `useDyteMeeting()`

This hook essentially returns the `meeting` object you passed to the
`DyteProvider`.

The value returned doesn't re-render always whenever properties inside the
object change. 

## `useDyteSelector()`

If you're familiar with Redux's
[useSelector](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector) hook, this hook
works in a similar way.

It allows you to extract data from the `meeting` object using a selector
function.

This hook will only cause a re-render when the actual data you returned for
changes.

Here is how you can get all the joined participants data:

```jsx
const joinedParticipants = useDyteSelector(
  (meeting) => meeting.participants.joined
);
```

the various properties of the `meeting` object.
