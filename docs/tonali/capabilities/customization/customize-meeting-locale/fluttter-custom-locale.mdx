Dyte's UI Kit allows you to customize all the text within the video call interface. You can personalize the text to align with your specific locale needs.

Customizing the locale involves the following steps:


1. Integrate Dyte’s SDK into your application
2. Download the default language reference file
3. Change the locale
4. Add the modified file to your app
