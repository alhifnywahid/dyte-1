# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to incorporate live video and audio into your React application using Dyte's Core SDKs. Core SDKs offer comprehensive customization and branding capabilities, enabling you to create your own user interface (UI) from scratch, without having to deal with complex media layers.

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize Dyte Client
- Connect to the meeting
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic
and completed the following steps:

- Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
- Create [Presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets). Dyte also includes the
  following pre-configured presets for group call and webinar. You can simply
  use the default preset if you don't wish to create one.
  - webinar_viewer
  - webinar_presenter
  - group_call_host
  - group_call_participant
- Create a [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
- [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting
- Install [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) or higher on your device

## Step 1: Install the SDK

You can install the package npm or Yarn.
  

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK
 
The `<DyteProvider />` provides the necessary context for the various hooks to consume the `meeting` object as per their purpose. Dyte provides the following built-in hooks for your usage:

- `useDyteClient()`
- `useDyteMeeting()`
- `useDyteSelector()`
 
To initialize, call the `init()` method and pass the `authToken`. You can get the `authToken` using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).
 
You can now use the `useDyteMeeting` and `useDyteSelector` hooks as required.

## Step 3: Connect to the Meeting

Now, you have established the connection with the Dyte meeting server successfully. Next step is to join the room and leave the room once the meeting is over.
